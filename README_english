# Tutorial for Smart Button using Nanofox IoT 
This page presents a Smart Button tutorial using Nanofox IoT kit and Sigfox network. 

Usually, a Smart Button is a button with connection to internet, that when it's pressed it can run a service. A few examples are emergency buttons, equipment maintenence calls, VIP service calls, etc..

In our tutorial, when the button is pressed, a message is sent to Tago.io platform which then sends a notification email.

## Recomendations
- [Arduino IDE instaled on your computer.](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)
- [Account registered on Tago Platform.](https://tago.io/)
- [Nanofox IoT kit activation.](https://github.com/Gridya/NANOFOX-Activate/blob/master/README.md)

## First step: Eletronic Circuit (Hardware)
The circuit is very simple, just consisting of a button connected to an I/O pin of Arduino (D2 in our example).
In our project, we opted to perform the board alimentation using the USB port (cable supplied with the kit), however, a external battery connected in the alimentation port can be used.

More informations about the board, like datasheet, schematic and use manual are disponible for [download.](https://github.com/Gridya/NANOFOX_Documentation)

## Second step: Arduino Programmation (Firmware)
  To realize the read of the button and send a message to Sigfox network, a very simple program was developed. The source code can be clonned from this repository, compiled and loaded in the Arduino Nano of the kit. 
  
  Follow below the source code and a breaf description:

}

void loop() {

  delay(10);
  
  while(digitalRead(2) == LOW){ // reading D2 Pin
    
    delay(2000); // 2 seconds delay to read the button again and confirm if it is pressed

    if(digitalRead(2) == LOW){ // If the button is pressed for more than 2 seconds, the Nanofox IoT sends a signal to Sigfox network
      Serial.println("Button pressed! Sending message to Sigfox network");  
      MyNanofox.Send_Payload_Sigfox(&Uplink_Buffer[0],1,&Downlink_Buffer[0],0);
    }
  }
}
  ```
  #### Necessary libraries: 
  The code utilize the [Nanofox library](https://github.com/Gridya/nanofox), responsible for the comunication with the Sigfox Wisol modem present in the kit.
  #### Setup Function:
  Because we need to read a button, we should treat the corresponding pin as input. In this case, we are going to chose D2 pin.
    Besides our necessary configuration for the project, we should add a few more things like the Arduino Nano IO configuration and the Sigfox WISOL modem initialization. In addition to that, in the forneced code we configured some messages to be printed in the serial monitor, this part is totally optional and the code works without it.  
  #### Loop Function
  In the main loop the button's state is monitored. If it is pressed for more than 2 seconds, a message is sent to Sigfox network.
  The messages should arrive in the Sigfox Backend similarly to the presented image below every time the button is pressed.

  ## Third Step: Integration of Tago Platform with Sigfox Backend
    This stage is very well explicated in a [tutorial written by Tago team](https://tago.elevio.help/en/articles/33). In this tutorial there are described the necessary configurations in the Tago Platform and how to create the necessary callbacks in Sigfox Backend to direct the sigfox messages to the application running in Tago.
    
    ## Fourth Step: Configuration for email sending using Tago Platform
    After the conclusion of the integration of Tago Platform with Sigfox Backend, let's create a trigger in the Tago Platform to send a email every time a message is received. To begin, we are going to access the option **Action** in the lateral menu of the Tago's developers page. After enter in **Action**, click on the button **Add Action** in the top right corner. So we entered in a new action to create. In the tab **General Information** we gave a name to our action, picked an action to be taken (**Send Email**) and we fill with the recipient, title and content of the email. The configuration in this tab should look like this: 
    
    [![general-information.png](https://i.postimg.cc/kXxqs3F1/general-information.png)](https://postimg.cc/3dJsrqqm "General Information tab configuration")
    
    Next, we need to go to the tab **Trigger**, in this tab we are going to configure when Tago Platform should send the email. We want that it sent always that a Sigfox signal is received by the platform, therefore, we should **configure the activation condition as Any** and we should pick a variable that is going to be monitored for the activation condition, in this case, we are going to pick **data** variable. In addition to that, we should **disable the option Lock trigger after action is taken**. Done all that, the configuration shoul look like this:
    
    [![trigger.png](https://i.postimg.cc/YCT6rzwG/trigger.png)](https://postimg.cc/XrcGxFq4 "Trigger tab configuration")
    
After that, our action is ready to be saved and used!

In the **Dashboard** area we included a table to visualize the ID of our device, dates and times when emails were sent:

[![tabela-emails.png](https://i.postimg.cc/6QJ4jc3d/tabela-emails.png)](https://postimg.cc/4YP3nzpd "Table with devide ID, dates and times")

Always that the Sigfox Button is pressed, a email like in the image is received by the service user.

Congratulations! You created a smart button using the most modern technologies of IoT!
